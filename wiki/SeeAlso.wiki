== Font Stash ==

An ever more minimalistic approach for rendering font in OpenGL using Sean Barret's [http://nothings.org/stb/stb_truetype.h truetype font rasterizer] and Bjoern Hoehrmann's [http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/ flexible and economical UTF-8 decoder].

== !FreeType on OpenGL ES ==

This project renders fonts using OpenGL ES and the !FreeType library. The !FreeType library uses font hinting, which makes the fonts look better than your average anti-aliased fonts. This project is primarily designed for the iPhone, however the code is portable and should work on other platforms.
