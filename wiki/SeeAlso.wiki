== FTGL ==

FTGL is a free cross-platform Open Source C++ library that uses Freetype2 to simplify rendering fonts in OpenGL applications. FTGL supports bitmaps, pixmaps, texture maps, outlines, polygon mesh, and extruded polygon rendering modes.

== FreeType on OpenGL ES ==

This project renders fonts using OpenGL ES and the FreeType library. The FreeType library uses font hinting, which makes the fonts look better than your average anti-aliased fonts. This project is primarily designed for the iPhone, however the code is portable and should work on other platforms.
