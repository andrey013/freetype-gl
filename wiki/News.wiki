I've been doing heavy code cleanup in order to reduce the internal dependencies. Now, only the vector, texture-atlas and texture-font are needed to put some glyphs in a texture. For the actual display, there is
no "official" API yet since you're can use different technics as illustrated in the different demos.

I also add a display list demo.

Added the makefont.c and demo-makefont.c demos. The makefont build a header file with all font information within (texture data, glyphs description with kerning, etc.) such that you can include this header file in your program and you have no dependency at all.

See the demo-makefont.c example. If you're curious, here is what a generated header file looks like: [http://code.google.com/p/freetype-gl/source/browse/trunk/arial-16.h arial-16.h]

Added the [http://code.google.com/p/freetype-gl/source/browse/trunk/demo-atb-agg.c demo-atb-agg.c] that allows to play with the different font settings to finely tune rendering.
