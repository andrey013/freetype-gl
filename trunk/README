Freetype GL - A C OpenGL Freetype engine
========================================

This code intends to show how to display fonts efficiently using regular C,
Freetype and OpenGL. The idea is to use a single texture and a single vertex
buffer. The code is fairly simple and organized as follow:

texture-atlas: This structure is responsible for the packing of small regions
               into a bigger texture. It is based on the skyline bottom left
               algorithm which appear to be well suited for storing glyphs.

vector:        This structure loosely mimics the std::vector class from c++. It
               is used by texture-atlas (for storing nodes), texture-font (for
               storing glyphs) and font-manager (for storing fonts).

texture-font:  The texture-font structure is in charge of creating bitmap
               glyphs and to upload them to the texture atlas.


texture-glyph: Simple structure that described a texture glyph (position within
               texture, advance, kerning, ...)

text-markup:   Simple structure that describes text properties (font family,
               font size, colors, underline, etc.)

font-manager:  Structure in charge of caching fonts.

vertex-buffer: Generic vertex buffer structure inspired by pyglet (python).
